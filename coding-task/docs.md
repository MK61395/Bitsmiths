Component Design: Server & Client
Mastering the distinction between Server and Client Components is key to building performant Next.js apps.

Server Components by Default: All components in the app directory are Server Components unless specified otherwise. Use them for:

Direct data fetching (from databases, ORMs, or APIs).

Keeping large dependencies and sensitive logic (API keys) on the server.

Reducing the client-side JavaScript bundle size.

'use client' for Interactivity: This directive marks the boundary where Server-rendering ends and the component (and all its children) become part of the client-side bundle. Use it only for components that need:

State and lifecycle effects (useState, useEffect, useReducer).

Event listeners (onClick, onChange).

Browser-only APIs (window, localStorage).

Custom hooks that depend on state or browser APIs.

Keep Client Components Small: Push client-side logic as far down the component tree as possible. Instead of making a whole page a Client Component, extract the interactive parts into their own smaller components.

Composition Pattern (Passing Server Components to Client Components): You cannot import a Server Component into a Client Component directly. However, you can pass Server Components as props (e.g., children) to Client Components. This allows you to keep most of your page static on the server while "slotting in" interactive client-side islands.

// app/page.tsx (Server Component)
import { ClientWrapper } from '@/components/ui/client-wrapper';
import { ServerInfo } from '@/components/server-info';

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <ClientWrapper>
      {/* This Server Component is rendered on the server and passed as children */}
      <ServerInfo />
    </ClientWrapper>
  );
}

Data Fetching & Caching
Next.js extends the native fetch API to provide automatic caching and revalidation.

Fetch in Server Components: Always prefer fetching data on the server. This is more secure and performant.

Parallel Data Fetching: To avoid sequential request waterfalls, initiate multiple data requests at the same time.

// app/dashboard/page.tsx
import { getProjects, getTeamMembers } from '@/lib/data-access';

export default async function DashboardPage() {
  // Both requests are initiated at the same time
  const [projects, teamMembers] = await Promise.all([
    getProjects(),
    getTeamMembers(),
  ]);

  return (/* ... JSX ... */);
}

Automatic Caching: By default, all fetch requests are aggressively cached. This is ideal for static data that rarely changes.

Revalidating Data:

Time-based Revalidation: Re-fetch data at a specified interval.

fetch('...', { next: { revalidate: 3600 } }); // Revalidate every hour

On-demand Revalidation: Manually trigger revalidation based on an event (e.g., after a form submission) using tags or paths. This is done inside Server Actions or Route Handlers.

// lib/actions.ts
import { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache';

export async function updateUser() {
  // ... update logic
  revalidateTag('users'); // Revalidates any fetch tagged with 'users'
}

Opting Out of Caching: For highly dynamic data that must always be fresh.

fetch('...', { cache: 'no-store' });

State Management
Choose the right state management strategy for the right context.

URL as State: For state that should be bookmarkable or shared, like filters or sorting, use URL Search Params. The useRouter and useSearchParams hooks are your tools here.

React Context for Global State: Best for slowly changing global state like theme or session data. Remember to create the provider in a Client Component.

Client-State Libraries (Zustand, Redux): For complex, high-frequency client-side state, a dedicated library is often the best choice.

Mutations with Server Actions
Server Actions are the primary way to handle data mutations (e.g., form submissions). They are secure, progressively enhanced, and simplify your code by co-locating frontend and backend logic.

Progressive Enhancement: Forms using Server Actions work even without JavaScript enabled.

useFormState & useFormStatus: Provide instant feedback to the user about the state of a form submission (pending, success, error).

Secure by Design: Server Actions run only on the server, preventing exposure of sensitive logic. Always re-validate user permissions inside a Server Action.

// components/ui/add-item-form.tsx
'use client';
import { useFormState, useFormStatus } from 'react-dom';
import { createItem } from '@/lib/actions';

const initialState = { message: null };

function SubmitButton() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus();
  return <button type="submit" disabled={pending}>{pending ? 'Adding...' : 'Add Item'}</button>;
}

export function AddItemForm() {
  const [state, formAction] = useFormState(createItem, initialState);
  return (
    <form action={formAction}>
      {/* ... form inputs ... */}
      <SubmitButton />
      <p>{state?.message}</p>
    </form>
  );
}

SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
Next.js provides powerful, file-based tools for maximizing SEO.

Metadata API:

Static Metadata: Export a metadata object from a layout.tsx or page.tsx.

Dynamic Metadata: Use the generateMetadata function to create metadata based on dynamic data (e.g., a blog post title).

// app/products/[id]/page.tsx
import { getProduct } from '@/lib/data-access';

export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  const product = await getProduct(params.id);
  return {
    title: product.name,
    description: product.description,
  };
}

Sitemaps: Create a sitemap.ts file in your app directory to dynamically generate your sitemap.xml, helping search engines discover all your pages.

robots.txt: Add a robots.txt file to the app directory to control web crawler access.

JSON-LD for Structured Data: Use JSON-LD to provide rich, structured data to search engines, which can result in enhanced search result snippets.

Performance Optimization
Partial Prerendering (PPR): The default in Next.js 14+, PPR combines fast initial static responses with dynamic streaming, providing the benefits of both SSG and SSR.

Lazy Loading Components: Use next/dynamic to lazy-load Client Components and large libraries that are not needed for the initial paint.

Image Optimization: Always use the next/image component. It provides automatic resizing, format optimization (WebP/AVIF), and lazy loading.

Font Optimization: Use next/font to automatically host and subset your fonts, preventing layout shifts and improving load times.

Bundle Analysis: Use @next/bundle-analyzer to inspect your client-side bundles and identify opportunities to reduce their size.

Security
Security is a first-class citizen in Next.js. Follow these critical practices.

Centralize Data Access & Auth (Data Access Layer): Do NOT perform authentication checks in Middleware. Middleware can run before all data is available. Instead, create a "Data Access Layer" (lib/data-access.ts) where you co-locate data fetching logic with user permission checks. Every function that accesses sensitive data should first verify the user's session and authorization.

Validate Input: Sanitize and validate all user input on the server, especially within Server Actions and Route Handlers, to prevent XSS, SQL injection, and other attacks.

Secure Server Actions: Always assume a Server Action can be called by any user. Re-authenticate the user's session at the beginning of every action that performs a sensitive mutation.

Taint Objects for Data Protection: Use the experimental taintObjectReference from React to prevent entire objects containing sensitive data from being accidentally passed from Server to Client Components.

Environment Variables: Keep all secrets (.env.local) out of version control. Only variables prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ are exposed to the browser.
