# Code Refactoring Plan

## Current Code Analysis

### What the Current Code Does
The application is a **Next.js issue tracking dashboard** that displays a table of software issues (errors, bugs, etc.) with the following functionality:

1. **Data Display**: Shows issues with name, message, status, and metadata
2. **Checkbox Selection**: Users can select individual issues or use a "select all" checkbox
3. **Status-based Interaction**: Only "open" issues can be selected; "resolved" issues are disabled
4. **Selection Counter**: Shows total selected issues and their combined value
5. **Visual Feedback**: Selected rows get background color changes and hover effects

### Current Issues Identified

#### 1. **Code Duplication**
- Repeated checkbox rendering logic for open vs resolved issues
- Duplicate status indicator rendering
- Repeated styling classes and conditional logic

#### 2. **Poor Naming Conventions**
- `selectDeselectAllIsChecked` - confusing double negative
- `numCheckboxesSelected` - verbose and unclear
- `handleIndeterminateCheckbox` - function name doesn't match its purpose

#### 3. **Complex State Management**
- `checkedState` array mixed with background colors
- Manual DOM manipulation for indeterminate checkbox state
- Complex state updates scattered across multiple functions

#### 4. **Performance Issues**
- Recalculating totals on every checkbox change
- Creating new arrays on every select/deselect all operation
- Inefficient array operations

#### 5. **Maintainability Issues**
- Large, monolithic component (214 lines)
- Mixed concerns (UI, state logic, calculations)
- Hardcoded values and magic numbers
- Complex conditional rendering

## Refactoring Strategy

### Phase 1: Extract Constants and Types
- Move magic numbers and strings to constants
- Improve type definitions
- Create reusable color and status constants

### Phase 2: Break Down Component
- Extract smaller, focused components
- Separate business logic from UI
- Create custom hooks for state management

### Phase 3: Optimize State Management
- Simplify checkbox state structure
- Use more efficient state updates
- Remove DOM manipulation

### Phase 4: Improve Logic and Performance
- Optimize calculations
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders
- Simplify conditional logic

### Phase 5: Enhance Readability
- Improve function and variable names
- Add concise, human-sounding comments
- Better code organization

## Expected Benefits

1. **Readability**: Clearer component structure and naming
2. **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused components easier to modify
3. **Performance**: Reduced unnecessary calculations and re-renders
4. **Reusability**: Extracted components can be reused elsewhere
5. **Testing**: Smaller components are easier to test individually
